Pomodoro Timer

Tech stack: jquery

I used a data URI for the timer beep. Data URI is a base64 encoded string that represents a file. This was the most interesting part of this project.

Click on big circle with time to start the timer.
Change break and session duration with - and +.
Click "Break" to skip to break and "Session" to skip to session.
Change volume with - and +, and test the beep by clicking on "Test Beep"
